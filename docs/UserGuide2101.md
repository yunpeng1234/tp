Intern Watcher (IW) is a **desktop app for Human Resource Managers to manage internship applicants, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, IW can get your applicant management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

You can use Intern Watcher to add, edit and delete the internship applicants. Intern Watcher also allows you to track applicants' details such as grades and skills, as well as filter applicants by their details.

This user guide covers a quick walk-through on how to use this application, as well as the full descriptions of the features available.

## Components Of Ui



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start


1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed on your computer. You can download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11).

Insert java screenshot with circle

2. Download the latest `internwatcher.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/releases/download/v1.4/internwatcher.jar).

Insert picture ( keep don't discard)

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Intern Watcher.

Insert table for mac and win ss


4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

If doesnt work, go to terminal and type java -jar command (FAQ)
<br>
![Ui](images/Ui.png)
5. Type any command in the command box and press the "Enter" key to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>

6. Here's an example usage of Intern Watcher:

* Let's start by adding a few applicants to Intern Watcher. `add n/John p/123 e/a@a.com g/4.50 i/NTU c/Computer Science y/06/2025 a/APPLIED` : Adds an applicant named `John` to Intern Watcher.

* You can try adding another applicant to the list: `add n/Jane p/999 e/b@b.com g/4.80 i/NTU c/Computer Science y/06/2025 j/software engineer a/APPLIED`.

* Say you only want to interview applicants studying computer science with a GPA greater than or equal to 4.80.
  `filter g/4.80 c/Computer Science` : Lists all applicants satisfying the criterias. Namely, applicant `Jane`.

Insert picture

* Let's give the filtered applicants the `SCHEDULED` application status to indicate our plans to interview them.
  `edit ALL a/SCHEDULED` : Edits all currently displayed applicants(`Jane`) to have the `SCHEDULED` application status.

* Say you do not wish to keep `John` in our records, since we have no plans to interview him. `find John`: Finds all applicants
  with a name containing `John`.

* `delete 1` will delete the first applicant in our `find` results.

* Perhaps after second consideration, you wish to reconsider `John`. `undo` : Undo the last command that you entered, namely `delete`.

* To view the skills `John` has, try `view 1 T` which will display the skills of the 1st applicant.

* Perhaps due to the incompatible skillset John has with regards to the job requirements, you make the final decision that `John` is not a good fit. `redo` : Reverses the last undo command, and deletes `John`.

* Typing `exit` will save the data we have and exit the application.

* If you encounter any problems, please refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.
