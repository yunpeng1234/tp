Intern Watcher (IW) is a **desktop app for Human Resource Managers to manage internship applicants, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, IW can get your applicant management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command formats:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  This excludes special tags for **`edit`** **`view`** **`delete`** commands. <br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.<br>
  e.g. in `delete ALL`, `ALL` is to be typed verbatim in full capital letters by the user.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [s/SKILL]` can be used as `n/John Doe s/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…+` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[s/SKILL]…+` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `s/Java`, `s/Python s/C` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
